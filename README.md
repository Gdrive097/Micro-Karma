# Micro-Karma: Daily Reddit Snapshot

Micro-Karma is a lightweight daily social game that turns subreddit activity into a conversation starter.

Each day, players generate a “snapshot of the day” for a subreddit and discuss **why the community behaved that way**.  
The comments are part of the gameplay.

## ✨ What is Micro-Karma?

Reddit communities often have days where:
- A topic suddenly explodes
- A post goes unexpectedly viral
- Nostalgia or controversy takes over the comments

Micro-Karma captures these moments as a **daily snapshot** and invites players to reflect and discuss them.

There are no scores, timers, or winners — the goal is **conversation**.

---

## 🎮 How it works

1. Enter a subreddit name (e.g. `AskReddit`)
2. Click **Generate Snapshot**
3. View today’s snapshot of community behavior
4. Discuss *why* the subreddit reacted this way
5. Come back tomorrow for a new snapshot

## 🧠 Daily mechanic

For this prototype:
- Snapshot content is generated deterministically
- Each interaction simulates a different “daily” state
- This demonstrates how the daily loop works

In a full version:
- Snapshots would be locked per day
- Content would be generated from live Reddit data
- The game would be deployed as a Reddit Interactive Post using Devvit
